# Introduction
This project presents the findings from a Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis conducted on a dataset from an online retail business. The dataset spans a period from December 2010 to December 2011 and is visualized through a cohort analysis heatmap generated using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

# Problem Statement
The online retail business seeks to understand customer retention patterns and how these patterns influence the company's revenue. 
There's a need to identify trends and patterns in customer purchasing behaviour over time. 
Specifically, the business aims to determine which cohorts of customers are most loyal and which are diminishing in engagement, as well as the potential revenue impact associated with these patterns.

# Key Insights
The cohort analysis chart provides several key insights into customer retention and value over time:

- **Customer Retention Across Cohorts**: There is a significant drop-off in customer retention after the first month across all cohorts, with most cohorts seeing less than 40% retention after the first month. This indicates a challenge in maintaining long-term customer engagement.

- **Highest Retention Cohorts**: The December 2010 cohort shows the highest retention rate consistently across several months, peaking at 50% in the twelfth month. This may indicate a strong initial customer base or successful holiday marketing strategies.

- **Decreasing Retention Over Time**: A general trend of decreasing retention is noticeable as cohorts age. By the time cohorts reach the twelfth month, retention levels are largely below 30%, with several cohorts as low as 9%.

- **Exceptions to Trends**: The June 2011 cohort deviates from the pattern with a significant retention increase to 34% in the fifth month. This anomaly could be due to specific marketing campaigns or seasonal effects that re-engaged customers.

- **Early Month Engagement**: Initial engagement within the first three months is relatively higher for later cohorts (September to November 2011), indicating effective acquisition strategies during these months.

# Recommendations
Based on the insights from the RFM analysis, the following recommendations are provided for the online retail business:

- **Improve Customer Retention Strategies**: Implement targeted customer retention strategies, such as personalized customer journey/marketing messages to improve retention rates after the first purchase.

- **Analyze High Retention Cohorts**: Investigate the reasons behind the high retention rates in specific cohorts, such as December 2010 and June 2011, and apply successful strategies across other cohorts.

- **Focus on the First Three Months**: Enhance engagement efforts during the first three months when customers are more likely to be engaged, as this is a critical period for establishing loyalty.

- **Monitor and Adjust Marketing Efforts**: Regularly monitor cohort behaviour to identify and respond to changes in customer engagement, and adjust marketing efforts accordingly to maximize retention.

- **Investigate Anomalies**: Look into the cause of unexpected retention patterns or spikes to understand the underlying factors that can be replicated or avoided in future strategies.
